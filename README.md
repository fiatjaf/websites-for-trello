This repository contains the code for the application that actually serves the websites created on https://websitesfortrello.com/. Besides the **Postgres database**, it doesn't interfaces with anything at all and doesn't support any kind of "write" operation.

All it does it to wait for `GET` requests to come, query the **database** for the data that should be served (based on the subdomain or the custom external domain of the request) and serve HTML in response.

Although this app doesn't interface directly with any of the other _Websites for Trello_ modules -- namely the [API](https://bitbucket.org/websitesfortrello/wft.api), the [dashboard](https://bitbucket.org/websitesfortrello/wft.website), the [webhook handler](https://bitbucket.org/websitesfortrello/wft.recv-webhooks) and the [database updater](https://bitbucket.org/websitesfortrello/wft.model-updates) --, because the other modules are responsible for keeping the database up to date and this app reads from the database, it depends on all these other parts to work properly.
