Every file or link you attach here will be included in your page, I mean CSS and Javascript files, so if they're named `anything.css` they will be included as CSS files, and if they're named `anything.js` they will be included as Javascript files. Javascript files will be included in the bottom of the page, while CSS files in the head.

Also, for any checklist you create in this card, the checked items, if they are URLs, will also be included in your site, just like the attachments. Checking and unckecking URLs this way can be useful, I don't imagine for what.

Use this to theme your site (we have some pre-made themes that will do great [here](https://github.com/fiatjaf/classless), but you must get a [usable link to them](http://rawgit.com/) that you can include directly in your pages). Also, you can do all sorts of magical includes, for example, to add a Javascript commenting system, web-analytics or amazing widgets.

We included some of the most common widgets you might want, such as Google Analytics and Disqus comments. If you want to activate one of them, just mark them as completed and edit the URL with your data (your Google Analtyics tracking code, your Disqus username etc.).

If you want a suggestion of a place to host custom Javascript and CSS to use in your site, host them as [Gists](https://gist.github.com/) and get a link to them at [RawGit](http://rawgit.com/).
